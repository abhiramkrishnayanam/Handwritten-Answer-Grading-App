# Handwritten Answer Grading System

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14706e6c-49db-42d0-b039-560293dc364f)

## Overview

This project provides an automated system to grade handwritten answers by comparing scanned student answer PDFs against an answer key PDF. The system extracts text from images of PDF pages using OCR, computes similarity scores between student answers and the answer key, and assigns marks accordingly. The entire process is accessible through a simple web interface built with Streamlit.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **PyMuPDF (fitz):** To render PDF pages as high-resolution images.
- **OpenCV:** For image preprocessing to enhance OCR accuracy.
- **PIL (Pillow):** For image manipulation.
- **Tesseract OCR:** To extract text from images.
- **FuzzyWuzzy:** To calculate similarity scores between answer texts.
- **Streamlit:** For building the user-friendly web application interface.

## Step-by-Step Approach

1. **PDF Rendering to Images**  
   The system converts each page of both the answer key and student answer PDFs into high-resolution images. This allows working with image data since the answers are handwritten.

2. **Image Preprocessing and OCR**  
   Each rendered page image undergoes preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, and denoising to improve OCR text extraction quality. Tesseract OCR is then applied to extract textual content from these images.

3. **Text Preprocessing**  
   Extracted texts are cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing whitespace, newlines, and punctuation to enable a fair comparison regardless of formatting variations.

4. **Similarity Scoring and Grading**  
   The cleaned student answer texts are compared to the corresponding answer key texts using fuzzy string matching (partial ratio). Marks are assigned proportionally based on similarity scores for each question.

5. **Output Generation**  
   The system generates a detailed CSV report containing each questionâ€™s extracted texts, similarity percentages, and marks awarded. It also saves the full extracted texts for reference.

6. **User Interface**  
   A Streamlit-based web app allows users to upload the answer key and student answer PDFs, specify total marks, run the grading pipeline, view results, and download the grading report.

## Execution Workflow

- PDFs are uploaded and temporarily saved.
- Pages are converted into images with high DPI for clarity.
- Images are preprocessed to enhance text visibility.
- OCR extracts text from each page image.
- Extracted texts are cleaned and compared for similarity.
- Marks are computed based on similarity percentages.
- Results and detailed reports are displayed and made available for download.

## Challenges and Resolutions

### Extracting Text from Handwritten Answers
Handwritten content is often noisy and irregular, making OCR difficult. To address this, preprocessing techniques such as thresholding and denoising are applied before OCR.

### Handling Variations in Text Formatting
Differences in spacing, capitalization, and punctuation can affect similarity calculations. The system cleans texts by removing these variations for consistent comparison.

### Matching Corresponding Pages Between PDFs
The system assumes answer key and student PDFs have the same number of pages/questions and processes them sequentially.

### Resource Management
Temporary files and directories are handled carefully to avoid clutter during batch processing.

## Possible Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced image preprocessing techniques to further enhance OCR accuracy on challenging handwritten text.
- Integrate deep learning-based handwriting recognition models to improve text extraction quality.
- Add a manual correction interface for users to edit OCR-extracted texts before grading.
- Support question-wise marking schemes and partial credit for multi-part answers.
- Extend compatibility for multi-column PDFs or answer sheets with complex layouts.
